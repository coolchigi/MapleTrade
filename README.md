## About 📝

**MapleTrade** is a multi-agent trading assistant uniquely tailored for Canadian day traders. It leverages Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Google Cloud to provide real-time intelligence, actionable trade ideas, and educational support for trading on Canadian markets.


## Motivation 🍁

While there are many trading tools globally, Canadian traders face unique challenges: limited local tools, complex tax/compliance laws, and a lack of educational resources. MapleTrade addresses this gap by:

- Focusing on Canadian exchanges (TSX, TSXV)
- Integrating Canadian market news and sentiment
- Providing explainable AI-driven recommendations and education
- Orchestrating specialized agents for automation and insight


## Project Concept 💡

MapleTrade is a **multi-agent trading assistant** that helps you:

1. **Monitor Canadian Stock Markets:** Real-time tracking of TSX/TSXV stocks.
2. **Analyze News & Sentiment:** Summarize financial news and social chatter around Canadian equities.
3. **Implement Trading Strategies:** Backtest and execute popular strategies (momentum, swing, mean-reversion).
4. **Make Trade Decisions:** Suggest or simulate trades with rationales and risk explanations.
5. **Educate & Alert:** Explain decisions, surface learning tips, and notify about compliance issues.


## Agent Architecture 🧠

MapleTrade leverages ADK to orchestrate several specialized agents:

| Agent                  | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Market Data Agent**      | Pulls real-time Canadian market data, detects price/volume anomalies           |
| **News & Sentiment Agent** | Scrapes news and social media, summarizes sentiment using NLP                  |
| **Strategy Agent**         | Runs trading strategies, backtests, and adapts based on performance            |
| **Trade Decision Agent**   | Decides buy/sell actions, interfaces with paper trading APIs                   |
| **Compliance Agent** (opt) | Checks trades for Canadian regulations (PDT, capital gains, TFSA/RRSP, etc.)   |
| **User Agent**             | Provides dashboard, explanations, alerts, and educational guidance            |
